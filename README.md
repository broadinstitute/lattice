# lattice.js

Lattice.js is a JavaScript library for creating coordinated multivariate visualizations for sciences. At its core, Lattice champions a 2D grid-based design approach, which offers an intuitive yet powerful visual solution for rendering multivariate data.


## Demos
To see demos of our sample use cases and basic plot types, visit https://lattice.broadinstitute.org.

## Installing and using lattice.js
Use `npm` to install the package in your project.
```
npm install lattice-viz
```

`import` the library to use lattice. There are 3 different imports you can use that will depend on your specific use case.
```
import { LatticeLib, Plot, Lattice } from "lattice-viz";
```
1. `LatticeLib` - This exposes basic usage of Lattice.js as a charting library, allowing someone to call `LatticeLib.plot(...)` or `LatticeLib.lattice(...)` to generate a lattice or a plot.
2. `Plot` - This allows someone to build their own visualization tool and instantiate a `Plot` object within it.
3. `Lattice` - Similarly to 2, this allows someone to build their own visualization tool and instantiate a `Lattice` object within it.

Data visualization developers who may want to layer additional interactive pieces on top of the base visualization are able to do so using options 2 and 3 in conjuction with [D3.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3).



## Developing the lattice.js library
### Getting started
After cloning the respository from GitHub, run `npm install` at the root of the repository.
